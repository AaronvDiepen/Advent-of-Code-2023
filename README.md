# Advent of Code 2023 in Rust

Repo containing over engineered solutions to Advent of Code 2023 in Rust, the aim of which is to broaden my understanding of multi-threaded and fast Rust practices.

After navigating to a day[X] and part[Y] the code can be run using ```cargo run``` or optimally be build using ```cargo build --release``` after which they can be ran using ```./day[X]-part[Y]```. As examples my personal input files that Advent of Code generated for me are contained in the repo so these can be used as examples.
