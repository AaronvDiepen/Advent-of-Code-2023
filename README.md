# Advent of Code 2023 in Rust

Repo containing over engineered solutions to Advent of Code 2023 in Rust, the aim of which is to broaden my understanding of multi-threaded and fast Rust practices.



## Run Locally

Make sure to install [Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)

Clone the project

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AaronvDiepen/Advent-of-Code-2023
```

After navigating to a day[X] and part[Y] the code can be run using

```bash
cargo run
```

Or optimally be build using 

```bash
cargo build --release
```

After which they can be ran using

```bash
./day[X]-part[Y]
```

As examples my personal input files that Advent of Code generated for me are contained in the repo so these can be used as examples.
